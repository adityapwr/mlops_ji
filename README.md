## Overview of Model Deployment

## Why is modern deployment challenging?

- Modern deployment presents the challenges of traditional software like reliability, reusability, maintainability and flexibility, and it also presents additional challenges that are specific to machine learning,like reproducibility.


- Reliability refers to the ability of the software to produce the intended result and to be robust to errors.

- Reusability refers to the ability of the software to be used across systems and across projects

-Maintainability is the ease with which we can maintain the software in time

-Flexibility is the ability of add or remove functionality from the software.

-Reproducibility instead refers to the ability of the software to produce the same result, given the same data across systems.

Let's discuss reproducibility in more detail in the rest of this session, more deployment is also challenging because it needs the coordination of various themes within an organization to ensure
that the more they produce the intended result and that it works reliably, it usually needs the coordination of data scientists who develop the machine learning model I.T. teams and software developers who help put the model in production, business professionals who understand how the model will be used in the
organization and the customers and purpose that it is intended to model.

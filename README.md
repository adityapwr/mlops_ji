## Overview of Model Deployment

## Why is modern deployment challenging?

- Modern deployment presents the challenges of traditional software like reliability, reusability, maintainability and flexibility, and it also presents additional challenges that are specific to machine learning,like reproducibility.


- Reliability refers to the ability of the software to produce the intended result and to be robust to errors.

- Reusability refers to the ability of the software to be used across systems and across projects

- Maintainability is the ease with which we can maintain the software in time

- Flexibility is the ability of add or remove functionality from the software.

- Reproducibility instead refers to the ability of the software to produce the same result, given the same data across systems.

## Let's discuss reproducibility in more detail 

- ML Model deployment is also challenging because it needs the coordination of various themes within an organization to ensure
that the more they produce the intended result and that it works reliably, it usually needs the coordination of
  - data scientists who develop the machine learning model 
  - I.T. teams and software developers who help put the model in   production
  - business professionals who understand how the model will be used in the organization and the customers and purpose that it is intended to model.
  
- Deployment is also challenging because there is often a discrepancy between the programming language in which the model is developed and the programming languages that are available in the production environments.

- If this is the case, then in the model to fit the languages available in production extends the project timeline and also risks the lack of reproducibility.

## Summary
- Model deployment is one of the most important stages in the machine learning lifecycle.

- And this is because to start using the machine learning model, it needs to be effectively deployed nto production so that it can provide its predictions to other software systems.

- In other words, to maximize the value of the machine learning model we create, we need to be able to reliably extract the predictions from the model and share them with other systems.
